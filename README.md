# @jemoka's config

ðŸ‘‹ Hewoooo! Here's my configuration repository. As my config is slightly different for each type of device, they live on difference branches:

- `macbooks` â€” newer MacBook(pro)s, anything that could follow the [t2linux](http://wiki.t2linux.org/) guide or has the terriable butterfly keyboard
- `legacy-macbooks` â€” older MacBooks not following the above description
- `fastcalculator` â€” headless or minimally-graphical systems that, although has graphics facilities, are more minimial and tty focused

The three configs actually share pretty similar code, but I haven't gotten around to find out the changes and create submodule-based or modular configs.
